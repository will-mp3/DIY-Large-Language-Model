    "## OPTIMIZERS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Squared Error:** MSE is a common loss function used in regression problems, where the goal is to predict a \n",
    "   continuous output. It measures the average squared distance between the predicted and actual values, and is\n",
    "   often used to train neural networks for regression tasks.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Gradient Descent:** Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used to minimize loss functions by \n",
    "   iteratively updating model parameters. It computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each \n",
    "   parameter and moves in the opposite direction of the gradient by a small step (learning rate). This method is \n",
    "   widely used in training machine learning models, but it can be slow and sensitive to learning rate selection.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Momentum:** Momentum is an extension of gradient descent that helps accelerate convergence by maintaining an \n",
    "   exponentially weighted moving average of past gradients. Instead of updating weights solely based on the current \n",
    "   gradient, it incorporates a fraction of the previous update to smooth out oscillations and improve stability. \n",
    "   This is particularly useful in training deep neural networks, where gradients can be noisy.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **RMSprop:** RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm designed to \n",
    "   address issues in gradient descent by maintaining a moving average of squared gradients for each parameter. It \n",
    "   normalizes the gradient updates using this average, preventing large swings in weight updates and improving \n",
    "   training stability, especially in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep learning tasks.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Adam:** Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) combines ideas from Momentum and RMSprop by keeping track of both \n",
    "   first-order (mean) and second-order (variance) moments of gradients. This allows it to adaptively adjust \n",
    "   learning rates for each parameter based on its history, leading to faster convergence and better performance on \n",
    "   complex deep learning tasks. Adam is widely used due to its efficiency and robustness.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **AdamW:** AdamW is a variant of Adam that improves weight regularization by decoupling weight decay from gradient \n",
    "   updates. Unlike Adam, which applies L2 regularization directly to the gradients, AdamW applies weight decay \n",
    "   directly to the parameters, leading to better generalization and preventing overfitting in deep learning models. \n",
    "   It is commonly used in modern architectures such as transformers."
